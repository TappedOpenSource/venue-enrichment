{"name": "The Wilma", "description": "The Wilma, also known as Wilma Theatre, is a historic cinema and events venue in Missoula, Montana, United States. Built in 1921 by William 'Billy' Simons and dedicated to his wife, Edna Wilma, a light opera artist, the venue was designed by Norwegian architect Ole Bakke. It features Sullivanesque architecture and was the first steel-framed high-rise building in Missoula. The venue includes a main 1400-seat hall, a lounge, three banquet rooms, a restaurant, apartments, and offices. The interior is adorned with Louis XIV Style gilt trim. In 2015, The Wilma was acquired by Missoula-based owners and underwent a major renovation to restore its historical aspects while updating production and customer services. It is now operated by Logjam Presents, which is committed to providing a superior live entertainment experience. The venue hosts a variety of events including independent movies, spoken word events, stand-up comedy, live and local music, plays, and other events.", "email": "info@logjampresents.com", "phone": "(406) 830-4640", "website": "https://logjampresents.com/venue/the-wilma/", "facebookUrl": "https://www.facebook.com/thewilmamissoula", "twitterUrl": "https://twitter.com/TheWilmaTheatre", "instagramUrl": "https://www.instagram.com/the_wilma_theatre/", "logoUrl": "https://scontent-iad3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/327464855_488221023499947_1306968965206532324_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_fb50_s320x320&_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=cc71e4&_nc_ohc=NBSd6QrpQBgQ7kNvgGbjHwb&_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-1.xx&oh=00_AYCcFcA9SskrxdmdkU7cdr8YjAc9W_NnqcQ2MXWIgM8HdA&oe=66B2A112", "idealPerformerProfile": ""}
