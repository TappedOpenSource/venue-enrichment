{"name": "The National", "description": "It is a music-lover\u2019s fantasyland with a state-of-the-art V-DOSC sound system, a large stage, and multiple video screens and monitors. The venue features wooden floors, brick walls, and five full bars, offering a stylish atmosphere. We have a 42X32X4.5 ft. stage with unlimited clearance for hanging sound and lights systems. You will have a great view of the stage from anywhere in the venue and to be sure you don\u2019t miss a single thing there are several video screens and monitors located throughout The National that show the concert. And it looks cool. With wooden floors, brick walls, and five full bars, the room\u2019s clean design and sharp style make any patron (and band) look good. The National is accessible via multiple bus routes and has parking decks directly behind the venue as well as metered street parking within walking distance.", "email": "NA", "phone": "804-612-1900", "website": "https://www.thenationalva.com/", "facebookUrl": "http://www.facebook.com/thenationalva", "twitterUrl": "http://www.twitter.com/TheNationalRVA", "instagramUrl": "http://www.instagram.com/thenationalva", "logoUrl": "https://aegwebprod.blob.core.windows.net/content/logo_images/400/gDSEaPsTERCqgpgCKzLaNLT2PvcaQiOtkMBZaFK9.png", "idealPerformerProfile": "NA"}
