{"name": "Moreland Theater", "description": "Moreland Theater is a single-screen movie theater located in the Sellwood neighborhood of Portland, Oregon in the United States. The theater was designed by Day Walter Hilborn or Thomas and Thomas and opened on September 10, 1925. It initially hosted vaudeville acts and screened silent films, and continues to screen first-run films. Moreland remains one of Portland's few historic single-screen theaters. The building was built to suit for the theater with a budget of $35,000 by Mr. George S. Smith, who already owned other Portland theaters. Thomas and Thomas Architects designed the building, which also houses several other retail spaces. It was built for an audience of 675 people, and was designed to be fireproof. The building has not been significantly altered since it was built, with the exception of a new marquee by Simonton and Steele in 1950. Steeped in a rich tapestry of entertainment history, the Moreland Theater stands as a testament to the enduring allure of classic cinema and community connection in Portland.", "email": "", "phone": "", "website": "https://morelandtheater.com", "facebookUrl": "https://www.facebook.com/morelandtheater", "twitterUrl": "", "instagramUrl": "https://www.instagram.com/morelandtheater/", "logoUrl": "https://morelandtheater.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/morelandtheater-logo-1.png", "idealPerformerProfile": ""}
